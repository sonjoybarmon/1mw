          If any amounts are due hereunder, you will pay us in accordance with
          statements issued by us or otherwise as agreed within the Service.
          Pricing for any portion of the Service is subject to change upon our
          notice. Pricing excludes, and you will pay, all taxes, but neither
          party will pay income taxes of the other party. For any amount you
          fail to pay by its due date, we may charge you a late penalty on the
          amount overdue each day it is overdue until it is paid, equal to the
          lesser of (a) the maximum legally permissible interest rate, and (b)
          an interest rate of five percent (5%), which reflects the cost of our
          efforts to collect your payment. You will pay amounts through the
          means determined by us, including without limitation through a payment
          service provided by us or a&nbsp;PSP. If a PSP is used, you may also
          be required to register with the PSP, agree to the PSP&lsquo; s terms
          of service and privacy policies, and go through a vetting process at
          the request of the PSP. Please note we are not a party to the
          PSP&lsquo; s terms of service and privacy policies and we have no
          obligations or liability to you under any such terms or policies.

          </li>
          <li>WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:</li>
          <li>
            You and all Affiliated Entities agree to resolve any claims relating
            to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that,
            to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to
            violate our intellectual property rights (for example, trademark,
            trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such
            circumstances, any Affiliated Entities may bring a lawsuit solely
            for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Site,
            or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade
            secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in
            arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described
            above.
          </li>
          <li>
            WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in
            court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge
            or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has
            the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.
            Thus, you agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to
            court to secure relief, and instead agree to the arbitration process
            as stated in this provision. If any provision of this arbitration
            agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall
            be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.
          </li>
          <li>
            ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
            interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.
            Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute,
            controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms
            shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in
            accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
            Procedures. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules
            set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in
            this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern. The JAMS Rules and
            instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from
            JAMS at&nbsp;http://www.jamsadr.com&nbsp;or 1-800-352-5267.
          </li>
          <li>
            To initiate arbitration, you or we must do the following things:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              (1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a
              description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be
              recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at
              www.jamsadr.com.
            </li>
            <li>
              (2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the
              appropriate filing fee to your local JAMS office.
            </li>
            <li>
              (3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other
              party.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
            governed by the JAMS Rules, except that for claims of less than
            $1,000, you will be obligated to pay $25 and we will pay all other
            administrative costs and fees. In addition, for claims of less than
            $1,000, we will reimburse you for the $25 fee if the arbitrator
            rules in your favor. Arbitration under this agreement shall be held
            in the United States county where you live or work, New Jersey, or
            any other location we mutually agree to, subject to New Jersey law.
            The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages
            and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on
            the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
            competent jurisdiction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and
          liabilities, if any, of you and us, and the dispute will not be
          consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
          parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions
          dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
          authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary
          remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the
          Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written
          award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and
          conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of
          any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
          relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
          have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
          us. The arbitrator&lsquo; s decision may be entered as a judgment in a
          court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          NO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only resolve disputes with us on an
          individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class
          member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class
          arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and
          consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
          AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
          JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall
          be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more
          limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court
          and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any
          litigation should arise between you and the Affiliated Entities in any
          state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration
          award or otherwise, BOTH PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
          TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU
          ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN
          ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
        </p>
        <p>
          OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You can decline this agreement to

          in our records. You must complete all required fields on our webform
          (or otherwise provide us with this information via the above toll-free

          or where necessary to process your request. If we are unable to
          adequately verify a request, we will notify the requestor. Authorized
          agents may initiate a request on behalf of another individual by
          contacting us via email or phone; authorized agents will be required
          to provide proof of their authorization and we may also require that
